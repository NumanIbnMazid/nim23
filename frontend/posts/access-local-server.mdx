In this article, I am going to show you how you can access your local/localhost server on any other device (Android or iOS). 

To access your local server, you only one thing **IP Address** of the device where the server is running. Now there could be two scenarios where you are using Windows or Mac. You just need to get the IP Address. Let me show you how:

Open windows terminal and type `ipconfig` in the command line and you will get the following output:

You only need an IPv4 address and as you get it not type this in your mobile browser followed by `PORT`. For instance-  

```bash
# IPv4:PORT 
192.168.64.201:3000
```
And if you are running any web app on `localhost:3000` then you will be able to see that on your mobile devices also.

For **Mac users** you have to do the same-
- Get the IPv4 (use `ifconfig` command)
- Put that on your mobile device followed by `PORT`

And hurray!!!

If you are unable to fine the mac IP address then you can take a look the following article:
