### Create Supabase Project

You need the following things
  * `SUPABASE_URL`: Database URL.
  * `SUPABASE_KEY`: It is safe to be used in a browser context.

  **Steps**

  * To get these go to [Supabase](https://app.supabase.com/sign-in) and log in with your account.

  * Click on **New Project** and fill all the fields.

  * Click on **Create New Project**.

  * Go to the [Settings](https://app.supabase.com/project/_/settings/general) page in the Dashboard.

  * Click **API** in the sidebar.

  * Find your API **URL** and **anon** key on this page.

  * Now you can [Create table](https://app.supabase.com/project/_/editor) and start using it.

    But before you use this there was one issue I had when I was using this it was returning the empty array ([]). It was because of project policies. By default, no-one has access to the data. To fix that you can do the following:

  * Go to [Policies](https://app.supabase.com/project/_/auth/policies).

  * Select your Project.

  * Click on **New Policy**.

  * You will be presented with two options. You can choose either one. I chose the 1st option:

  * After that, you will have four options as shown in the following image. You can choose according to your need. I only need the read access so I went with 1st option.

  * Click on **Use this template**.

  * Click on **Review**.

  * Click on **Save Policy**

    After that, you will be able to access the data using [@supabase/supabase-js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@supabase/supabase-js). Install it and you just set up your project with Supabase.
