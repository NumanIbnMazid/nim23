In this article, I will explain how you can create an RSS feed for your Next.js application in XML and JSON format. So without further delay, let's get into it.


## What is RSS?

An RSS (Really Simple Syndication) feed is a file that contains a summary of updates from a website, often in the form of a list of articles with links.

In my case, I am creating an RSS feed for my blogs to show the latest blogs as the site updates. The user doesn't need to visit to check if there is an update or a new blog. RSS sends you the notification or shows the list of updates. You can use [RSS Feed Reader](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/rss-feed-reader/pnjaodmkngahhkoihejjehlcdlnohgmp?hl=en) chrome extension to manage your feed.

## What do we need?

- We need all the blogs' data
- install the `feed` package
- Create RSS Feed


## Method-1
### Getting the Blogs' data

I am assuming you already have your blog page where all the blogs are listed. I am using [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) for managing the blog content. You might be using the same or anything else that doesn't matter. The main thing is you need to have an array containing all the blogs.

As I am using the MDX, that's how I fetch all my blogs.

<CodeTitle lang="js" title="lib/posts.js" />

```jsx
export function getAllPosts() {
  const posts = getSlugs()
    .map((slug) => {
      return getFrontMatter(slug);
    })
    .filter((post) => post != null || post != undefined) // Filter post if it is not published
    .sort((a, b) => {
      if (new Date(a.date) > new Date(b.date)) return -1;
      if (new Date(a.date) < new Date(b.date)) return 1;
      return 0;
    });
  return posts;
}
```

The above function gets all the blogs by fetching all the `slugs` and the for every slug it returns the `frontMatter` of that blog and then sorted it in descending order by date, which contains information like title, publishedDate, excerpt, etc. Now we use this information to create the RSS feed.

### Install the `feed` package

It's very simple, you just have to install the package called `feed` to create RSS. You can install it with `npm` or `yarn`, whatever you prefer.

<CodeTitle lang="bash" title="bash" />

```bash
yarn add feed
# or
npm i feed
```

### Create RSS Feed

To generate the RSS feed we create a function called `generateRssFeed`. You can change the name if you want.

<Step id={1}>
  First, we import all the important packages or functions.
</Step>

<CodeTitle lang="js" title="lib/generateRssFeed.js" />

```js {1-3}
import fs from "fs";
import { Feed } from "feed";
import { getAllPosts } from "./posts";
```

<Step id={2}>
  Create a function called `generateRssFeed` and we are exporting it, which I'll
  talk about later in this article.
</Step>

<CodeTitle lang="bash" title="lib/generateRssFeed.js" />

```js {5}
import fs from "fs";
import { Feed } from "feed";
import { getAllPosts } from "./posts";

export default async function generateRssFeed() {}
```

<Step id={3}>
  Now we add the following information in the above function such as all the
  blogs, today's date, and the author and the siteURL.
</Step>

<CodeTitle lang="js" title="lib/generateRssFeed.js" />

```js {6-13}
import fs from "fs";
import { Feed } from "feed";
import { getAllPosts } from "./posts";

export default async function generateRssFeed() {
  const posts = getAllPosts();
  const siteURL = process.env.VERCEL_URL;
  const date = new Date();
  const author = {
    name: "John Doe",
    email: "example@gmail.com",
    link: "https://twitter.com/<username>",
  };
}
```

In the above code, I've used the `process.env.VERCEL_URL` as the siteURL. You might be wondering why I used that. In my case, I am using [vercel](https://vercel.com/) to host my website. So we need to pass the siteURL to the RSS. In the production or Preview in Vercel, it provides us the environment variable called `VERCEL_URL` which is nothing but your site root URL. For example `https://google.com`. We need the root URL for the production as well as the development phase because we need to check if our RSS is working or not. That's why I've chosen `VERCEL_URL` as the environment variable. My `.env.local` looks like this-

<CodeTitle title=".env.example" />

```env
VERCEL_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

<Tip>
  You don't need to define that in your production if you are also using the
  Vercel as a hosting platform. Otherwise, you can simply add your site root
  URL.
</Tip>

<Step id={4}>After that we will create a feed.</Step>

<CodeTitle lang="js" title="lib/generateRssFeed.js" />
```js {15-30}
import fs from "fs";
import { Feed } from "feed";
import { getAllPosts } from "./posts";

export default async function generateRssFeed() {
  const posts = getAllPosts();
  const siteURL = process.env.VERCEL_URL;
  const date = new Date();
  const author = {
    name: "John Doe",
    email: "example@gmail.com",
    link: "https://twitter.com/<username>",
  };

  const feed = new Feed({
    title: "Your Blog name",
    description: "Your Blog description",
    id: siteURL,
    link: siteURL,
    image: `${siteURL}/favicon.ico`,
    favicon: `${siteURL}/favicon.ico`,
    copyright: `All rights reserved ${date.getFullYear()}, Jatin Sharma`,
    updated: date, // today's date
    generator: "Feed for Node.js",
    feedLinks: {
      rss2: `${siteURL}/rss/feed.xml`,  // xml format
      json: `${siteURL}/rss/feed.json`,// json fromat
    },
    author,
  });
}
```

The above code creates an RSS feed in `XML` and `JSON` format.

<Step id={5}>Add Blogs to the Feed</Step>

Now, as our feed is created, we just need to add all the blogs in that feed. To do that, we loop through the array of blogs and add the blog to the feed. The following code shows how you can do it.

<CodeTitle lang="js" title="lib/generateRssFeed.js" />

```js {32-44}
import fs from "fs";
import { Feed } from "feed";
import { getAllPosts } from "./posts";

export default async function generateRssFeed() {
  const posts = getAllPosts();
  const siteURL = process.env.VERCEL_URL;
  const date = new Date();
  const author = {
    name: "John Doe",
    email: "example@gmail.com",
    link: "https://twitter.com/<username>",
  };
  
  const feed = new Feed({
    title: "Your Blog name",
    description: "Your Blog description",
    id: siteURL,
    link: siteURL,
    image: `${siteURL}/favicon.ico`,
    favicon: `${siteURL}/favicon.ico`,
    copyright: `All rights reserved ${date.getFullYear()}, Jatin Sharma`,
    updated: date, // today's date
    generator: "Feed for Node.js",
    feedLinks: {
      rss2: `${siteURL}/rss/feed.xml`,  // xml format
      json: `${siteURL}/rss/feed.json`,// json fromat
    },
    author,
  });

  posts.forEach((post) => {
    const url = `${siteURL}/blog/${post.slug}`;
    feed.addItem({
      title: post.title,
      id: url,
      link: url,
      description: post.excerpt,
      content: post.excerpt,
      author: [author],
      contributor: [author],
      date: new Date(post.date),
    });
  });
}
```

This code is straight forward and we just add the important data to the feed.

<Step id={6}>Write the rss files in the public folder</Step>

After all this, we just need to make an `xml` and `json` file. The following code will create `xml` and `json` files for the RSS feed.

<CodeTitle lang="js" title="lib/generateRssFeed.js" />

```js {46-48}
import fs from "fs";
import { Feed } from "feed";
import { getAllPosts } from "./posts";

export default async function generateRssFeed() {
  const posts = getAllPosts();
  const siteURL = process.env.VERCEL_URL;
  const date = new Date();
  const author = {
    name: "John Doe",
    email: "example@gmail.com",
    link: "https://twitter.com/<username>",
  };
  
  const feed = new Feed({
    title: "Your Blog name",
    description: "Your Blog description",
    id: siteURL,
    link: siteURL,
    image: `${siteURL}/favicon.ico`,
    favicon: `${siteURL}/favicon.ico`,
    copyright: `All rights reserved ${date.getFullYear()}, Jatin Sharma`,
    updated: date, // today's date
    generator: "Feed for Node.js",
    feedLinks: {
      rss2: `${siteURL}/rss/feed.xml`,  // xml format
      json: `${siteURL}/rss/feed.json`,// json fromat
    },
    author,
  });
  
  posts.forEach((post) => {
    const url = `${siteURL}/blog/${post.slug}`;
    feed.addItem({
      title: post.title,
      id: url,
      link: url,
      description: post.excerpt,
      content: post.excerpt,
      author: [author],
      contributor: [author],
      date: new Date(post.date),
    });
  });

  fs.mkdirSync("./public/rss", { recursive: true });
  fs.writeFileSync("./public/rss/feed.xml", feed.rss2());
  fs.writeFileSync("./public/rss/feed.json", feed.json1());
}
```

Now, we just need to call this function to generate the feed as the data is updated. To do that we call this function inside the `getStaticProps` in `pages/index.js` because whenever our site is built and deployed, our RSS feed will be created and updated as well.

<CodeTitle lang="js" title="pages/index.js" />

```js {6}
// first import that function
import generateRSS from "../lib/generateRssFeed";

export async function getStaticProps() {
  // ........
  await generateRSS(); // calling to generate the feed
  // ........
}
```

<Tip>
  I didn't want to push the RSS files to GitHub, because it is not necessary.
  That's why I put `/public/rss` in the `.gitignore`.
</Tip>

That's it everything is done. Now if you are in the development then you can go to the [localhost:3000/rss/feed.xml](http://localhost:3000/rss/feed.xml) and if you are in the production then you can just simply go to `https://yoursite.com/rss/feed.xml`. You will find the RSS in `xml` format. In case you want to get the `json` data just use `https://yoursite.com/rss/feed.json`.



## Method-2

### Install `rss` package
In the second method you need to install the `rss` package through `npm` or `yarn`

<CodeTitle lang="bash" title="bash" />

```bash
yarn add rss
# or
npm i rss
```

### Generating RSS

To generate an RSS feed, you need to create a function the same as we did in the previous method.

<CodeTitle lang="js" title="lib/generateRssFeed.js" />

```js
import { writeFileSync } from "fs";
import { getAllPosts } from "./posts";
import RSS from "rss";
export default async function getRSS() {
  const siteURL = "https://yourdomain.com";
  const allBlogs = getAllPosts();

  const feed = new RSS({
    title: "Your Name",
    description: "your description",
    site_url: siteURL,
    feed_url: `${siteURL}/feed.xml`,
    language: "en",
    pubDate: new Date(),
    copyright: `All rights reserved ${new Date().getFullYear()}, Your Name`,
  });

  allBlogs.map((post) => {
    feed.item({
      title: post.title,
      url: `${siteURL}/blogs/${post.slug}`,
      date: post.date,
      description: post.excerpt,
    });
  });

  writeFileSync("./public/feed.xml", feed.xml({ indent: true }));
}
```

### Call the function

As we did in the previous method we can call it inside the `getStaticProps` in `pages/index.js`

<CodeTitle lang="js" title="pages/index.js" />

```js {6}
// first import that function
import generateRSS from "../lib/generateRssFeed";

export async function getStaticProps() {
  // ........
  await generateRSS(); // calling to generate the feed
  // ........
}
```

After applying this method you just need to visit the `/feed.xml` and it'll give you the result. For example - `https://youdomain.com/feex.xml`


My [RSS feed](/feed.xml) is live right now you can check it out.

## Wrappig up
This is how you can add RSS feed to your own blog or side via using Next.js and some npm pacakges. This will help users in fetching the RSS stream to their RSS reader.
