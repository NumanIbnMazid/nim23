In this article, we are gonna look at some javascript methods that you should know. You might know some as well if yes then feel free to skip that particular section. So let's get into it.

## concat(..)

This method can be used in Array as well as in strings. this joins the two variables or parts together if they belong to the same data type.

<CodeTitle lang="js" title="script.js" />
```js
let a = "foo";
let b = ["f", "o", "o"];

let c = a.concat("bar"); // "foobar"
let d = b.concat(["b", "a", "r"]); // ["f","o","o","b","a","r"]
```

Since it doesn't' not change the actual variable so we always need to store the value returns from `concat`
for example -

<CodeTitle lang="js" title="script.js" />
```js
console.log(a); // "foo"
console.log(b); // [ 'f', 'o', 'o' ]
console.log(c); // "foobar"
console.log(d); // [ 'f', 'o', 'o', 'b', 'a', 'r' ]
```

## reverse()

Arrays have a `reverse()` in-place mutator method, but strings do not so we can only use it in arrays and not for strings.

<CodeTitle lang="js" title="script.js" />
```js
let a = "foo";
let b = ["f", "o", "o", "!"];

a.reverse; // undefined
b.reverse(); // ["!","o","O","f"]
console.log(b); // ["!","o","O","f"]
```

Since this method cannot reverse string so the question is how we can reverse sting? The answer is simple we have to make a function for it.

<CodeTitle lang="js" title="script.js" />
```js
let a = "foo";

// function for reversing a string
function reverseString(str) {
  return str.split("").reverse().join("");
}

console.log(a); // "foo"

let b = reverseString(a);
console.log(b); // "oof"
```

`reverseString()` method returns the value so we need to store that in the variable and voila it works. In the above example, we are just taking a string and splitting it into an array then we use the `reverse()` and `join()` back together.

## split(..)

In the previous section we used the `split()` method now let's see how it actually works.

<CodeTitle lang="js" title="script.js" />
```js
let a = "foo";
let arr = a.split("");

console.log(a); // foo
console.log(arr); //  [ 'f', 'o', 'o' ]
```

`split()` method returns an array and it splits based on what you passed as the argument in that. For example:

## join(..)

In the the previous example we used the `join()` as well it was for to convert the array into the string.

<CodeTitle lang="js" title="script.js" />
```js
let a = ["f", "o", "o", "!"];
let str = a.join("");

console.log(a); // [ 'f', 'o', 'o', '!' ]
console.log(str); //  foo!
```

## toExponential()

This method converts the value to the exponential as we can already understand by name of it. Let's see how we can implement it.

<CodeTitle lang="js" title="script.js" />
```js
let a = 5e7;
console.log(a); // 50000000
let b = a.toExponential();
console.log(b); // 5e+7
```

Now, what if we use some mathematical operations in it. let's see.

<CodeTitle lang="js" title="script.js" />
```js
var c = b * b;
console.log(c); // 2.5e+21
var d = 1 / b;
console.log(d); // 2e-11
```

## toFixed(..)

`toFixed(..)` method allows you to specify how many fractional
decimal places you’d like the value to be represented with:

<CodeTitle lang="js" title="script.js" />
```js
let a = 42.59;
a.toFixed(0); // "43"
a.toFixed(1); // "42.6"
a.toFixed(2); // "42.59"
a.toFixed(3); // "42.590"
a.toFixed(4); // "42.5900"
```

## toPrecision(..)

`toPrecision(..)` is similar, but specifies how many significant digits should be used to represent the value:

<CodeTitle lang="js" title="script.js" />
```js
var a = 42.59;
a.toPrecision(1); // "4e+1"
a.toPrecision(2); // "43"
a.toPrecision(3); // "42.6"
a.toPrecision(4); // "42.59"
a.toPrecision(5); // "42.590"
```

Some other example -

<CodeTitle lang="js" title="script.js" />
```js
42.toFixed( 3 ); // SyntaxError

// these are all valid:
(42).toFixed( 3 ); // "42.000"
0.42.toFixed( 3 ); // "0.420"
42..toFixed( 3 ); // "42.000"
```

`42.toFixed(3)` is invalid syntax, because the . is swallowed up as part of the `42`. literal (which is valid—see above!), and so then there’s no. property operator present to make the `.toFixed` access.

`42..toFixed(3)` works because the first `.` is part of the number and the second `.` is the property operator. But it probably looks strange, and indeed it’s very rare to see something like that in actual Java‐Script code.

## Wrapping up

There are a bunch more methods that I have not covered such as `length`, `indexOf`, `toUpperCase`, and so on. Maybe we will cover those in the future.
