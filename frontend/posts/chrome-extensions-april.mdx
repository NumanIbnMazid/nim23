In this article, we are going to look at some of the best extensions that you need to install for better productivity. So without further due, let's get into it.


## 1. Grepper

The [Grepper](https://cutt.ly/vGj0rWd) is the ultimate RAM upgrade for the software developer's brain. Easily snag code examples from around the web, then access your code examples without having to think.

## 2. Fake Filler

[Fake Filler](https://cutt.ly/aGj0bSa) is the form filler to fill all input fields on a page with randomly generated fake data. This productivity boosting extension is a must for developers and testers who work with forms as it eliminates the need for manually entering values in fields.

## 3. Extensity

## 4. daily.dev

[daily.dev](https://cutt.ly/xGj2yl4) is the fastest growing online community for developers to stay updated on the best developer news. Get all the content you love in one place collected from +400 sources.

## 5. Dimensions

[Dimensions](https://cutt.ly/aGj2E8T) extension measures the dimensions from your mouse pointer up/down and left/right until it hits a border. So if you want to measure distances between elements on a website this is perfect. It doesn't really work with images because there the colors change a lot pixel to pixel.

## 6. Mailtrack

Free and unlimited tracking for Gmail. [Mailtrack](https://cutt.ly/hGj2ZPh) is a personal email marketing tool with Campaigns, Mail Merge and PDF document tracking from Gmail.

## 7. GitHub Code Folding

[GitHub Code Folding](https://cutt.ly/jGj24In) - the ability to selectively hide and display sections of a code - is an invaluable feature in many text editors and IDEs. Now, developers can utilize that same style code-folding while poring over source code on the web in GitHub. Works for any type of indentation, spaces or tabs.

## 8. Hide Scrollbar

Sometimes I hate the scrollbar in the browser. That's where this [Hide Scrollbar](https://cutt.ly/SGj9sxR) extension comes into play. This extension allows you to hide the scrollbars on any page while still allowing you to use the scroll functionality. It helps provide a minimal style for any webpage.

## 9. I don't care about cookies

[I don't care about cookies](https://cutt.ly/zGj9RFh) extension removes cookie warnings from almost all websites. In most cases, it just blocks or hides cookie related pop-ups. When it's needed for the website to work properly, it will automatically accept the cookie policy for you (sometimes it will accept all and sometimes only necessary cookie categories, depending on what's easier to do). It doesn't delete cookies.

## 10. Material Icons for GitHub

Replace the file/folder icons on the GitHub file browser with icons representing the file's type and which tool it is used by.
Replace GitHub's default icons with icons from Visual Studio Code's Material Icon Theme icons. Use the same icons on your code editor and on github.com, and quickly identify file types, configuration files and project scaffolding at a glance.

## Wrapping Up

These were some extensions for this month (April). I have personally used all the above extensions and from my experience, every extension is worth installing.
