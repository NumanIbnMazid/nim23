In this article, I will solve a [Tesseract](https://cssbattle.dev/play/9) CSS Challenge on [CSS Battle](https://cssbattle.dev/). Let's look at the [problem](https://cssbattle.dev/play/9) first.

## Problem 

We need to create the following container by using CSS Properties only:
![Tesseract](https://cssbattle.dev/targets/9.png)

## Solution

So now look at the Solution and how we are going to achieve this. 

### HTML

<CodeTitle title="index.html" lang="html"/>

```html
<div class="rect"></div>
<div class="square"></div>
<div class="circle"></div>
```


### CSS


<CodeTitle title="styles.css" lang="css"/>
```css
body {
  margin: 0;
  background: #222730;
  display: grid;
  place-items: center;
}
.rect {
  width: 100%;
  height: 150px;
  background: #4caab3;
}
.square {
  position: absolute;
  width: 150px;
  height: 150px;
  background: #4caab3;
  transform: rotate(45deg);
  box-shadow: 0 0 0 50px #222730;
}
.circle {
  position: absolute;
  width: 50px;
  height: 50px;
  background: #393e46;
  border-radius: 50px;
}
```


<Tip id="1">
  Note: In CSS Battle you can use `100` instead of `100px`. You don't need to define `px` in CSS. However, if you are using `rem` or `%`, you need to pass them separately. That's why in the above CSS code there are no units mostly. For more info [visit here](https://cssbattle.dev/tips).
</Tip>

<Tip id="2">
  Minify the code or CSS by using any [CSS Minifier](https://www.minifier.org/). It helps you to reduce the characters in the code which will increase the score.
