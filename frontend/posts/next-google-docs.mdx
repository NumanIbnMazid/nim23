In this article, I am going to explain how I made the Google Docs clone with the help of Next.js and Tailwind CSS. I am not going to explain the whole code in this article but will discuss some key features of the code which are important.


## Technologies I've used

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) is an open-source development framework built on top of Node.js enabling [React](https://reactjs.org/) based web applications functionalities such as server-side rendering and generating static websites.
- [NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org/) is **a complete open source authentication solution for Next.** **js applications**. It is designed from the ground up to support Next. js and Serverless.
- [Draft.js](https://draftjs.org/) fits seamlessly into React applications, abstracting away the details of rendering, selection, and input behavior with a familiar declarative API.
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) is a platform developed by Google for creating mobile and web applications. I am using Cloud Firestroe from the Firebase which lets you store all the users' info and also the documents.
- [Material Tailwind](https://material-tailwind.com/) is an easy to use components library for Tailwind CSS and Material Design. It features multiple React components, all written with Tailwind CSS classes and Material Design guidelines.
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) is basically **a utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces**. It is a highly customizable, low-level CSS framework that gives you all of the building blocks you need.

## How to start?

### Create Next app

To create a Next.js app, open your terminal, `cd` into the directory you’d like to create the app in, and run the following command:

<CodeTitle lang="bash" title="bash" />

```bash
npx create-next-app <project-name>
```

After that visit the directory and start the server by using-

<CodeTitle lang="bash" title="bash" />
```bash
cd <project-name>
npm run dev
```

if you are using `yarn` then to start the server type `yarn dev` in the terminal.

For more info about Create Next app [Visit Here](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-nextjs-app/setup)

### Setup Tailwind CSS

<CodeTitle lang="bash" title="bash" />
```bash
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
npx tailwindcss init -p
```

We need to update `tailwind.config.js` to do that look at [Tailwind CSS Guide](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/nextjs) and folllow the steps.

### Other dependencies

<CodeTitle lang="json" title="package.json" />
```json
"dependencies": {
	"@emotion/react": "^11.7.1",
	"@material-tailwind/react": "0.3.4",
	"@next-auth/firebase-adapter": "^0.1.3",
	"draft-js": "^0.11.7",
	"firebase": "^9.6.6",
	"next": "12.0.10",
	"next-auth": "3.29.0",
	"next-nprogress-emotion": "^2.0.0",
	"next-pwa": "^5.4.4",
	"react": "17.0.2",
	"react-dom": "17.0.2",

	"eslint-config-next": "12.0.10",
	"postcss": "^8.4.6",
	"tailwindcss": "^3.0.18"
}
```

You can install each dependency as you progress further in the project. such as firebase and next-auth etc you can visit their setups.

### Setting `.env.local`

`.env.local` has three values which you need to pass to run this project.

- **`NEXTAUTH_URL`**: In the development mode, it should be https://localhost:3000 and in production, you need to change it to your website homepage URL.
- **`GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`** & **`GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`**: go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) and login with you gmail. Then Create a new Project and fill all the necessary information and click on **Create** button.
  ![newproject](https://i.imgur.com/s98aDln.png)
  After creating a project there will be a search bar in that search for **APIs & Services** or just [click here](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/dashboard). After visiting the page you need to make sure that you have selected you project or swithc the project if needed.
  ![selectproject](https://i.imgur.com/7HctR6n.png)
  After selecting you desided project the visit the **Credentials** section on the left sidebar
  ![credentials](https://i.imgur.com/hTeIqRp.png)
  After that there will be an new option to **Create Credentials** click on it.
  ![create Credential](https://i.imgur.com/9OZheKd.png)
  There will be a new menu then click on **OAuth client ID**
  ![oauth](https://i.imgur.com/reUPgFy.png)
  It will show you a warning to **Configure Consent Screen** click on it.
  ![consent screen](https://i.imgur.com/1HxVd2A.png)
  After that select the user type as **External** and click on **Create** button.
  ![option](https://i.imgur.com/8IZ1kAN.png)
  After that there will a form which needs to be filled. After filling that form save the data. And go to credential again and Create a new Credentials.
  As you progress further then there will be some field which you need to fill very carefully.
  It should be the **Domain** of your web app such as `https://example.com`
  ![js auth domain](https://i.imgur.com/FiQOzvT.png)
  After that you need to fill the redirect URI or callback URL which will show when you click on login button.
  For the producation it should be like `https://example.com/api/auth/callback/google`
  ![callbackuri](https://i.imgur.com/eMNN9Zt.png)
  After completing all the process you'll get your **Client ID** and **Client Secret** on the top-right corner which will look something like this-
  ![secret](https://i.imgur.com/kJgsZcS.png)
  And after that you are done just paste these in the project and restart your server.

<Warning

    "I want to inform you in advance that it is not very secure and the admin (which is me) can see the documents created by the other users for now. It's not end-to-end encrypted. I have made this just for fun and to learn something new. It is my responsibility to let you know about the downside of it. The below images show how It looks like from my perspective."

## Inspiration

I've taken inspiration from [Sonny Sangha](https://bit.ly/3v4JPrl) and he made a full tutorial for this if you are interested then visit his YT channel and watch his content he is doing the really amazing Job. I've added some more features and other things to create something new.
