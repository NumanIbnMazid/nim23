In this article, I will solve a [Ups n Downs](https://cssbattle.dev/play/4) CSS Challenge on [CSS Battle](https://cssbattle.dev/). Let's look at the [problem](https://cssbattle.dev/play/4) first.

## Problem

We need to create the following container by using CSS Properties only:
![Ups n Downs](https://cssbattle.dev/targets/4.png)

## Solution

So now look at the Solution and how we are going to achieve this.

### HTML

<CodeTitle title="index.html" lang="html" />
```html
<p class="left"></p>
<p class="middle"></p>
<p class="right"></p>
```

### CSS

Now let's style the containers.

<CodeTitle title="styles.css" lang="css"/>
```css
body {
  margin: 0;
  background: #62306d;
}
.middle,
.left,
.right {
  position: absolute;
  background: #f7ec7d;
  width: 100;
  height: 100;
  border-radius: 10rem 10rem 0 0;
  margin-top: 50;
}
.middle {
  left: 150;
}
.left,
.right {
  transform: rotate(180deg);
  bottom: 34;
}
.left {
  left: 50;
}
.right {
  right: 50;
}
```

<Tip>
  In CSS Battle you can use `100` instead of `100px`. You don't need to define
  `px` in CSS. However, if you are using `rem` or `%` then you need to pass them
  separately. That's why in the above CSS code there are no units mostly. For

## Alternate Solution

There could be many Alternative Solution I've used this one because of the less characters and simplicity.

### HTML

<CodeTitle title="index.html" lang="html" />

```html
<p l></p>
<p m></p>
<p r></p>
```

Here I am using `<p>` tag and inside them `l` stands for `left`, `m` stands for `middle` and `r` stands for `right`.

### CSS

<CodeTitle title="styles.css" lang="css"/>
```css
body{
  margin:0;
  background:#62306D;
}
p[m],p[l],p[r]{
  position:absolute;
  background:#F7EC7D;
  width:100;
  height:100;
  border-radius:10rem 10rem 0 0;
  margin-top:50;
}
p[m]{
  left:150;
}
p[l],p[r]{
  transform:rotate(180deg);
  bottom:34;
}
p[l]{
  left:50;
}
p[r]{
  right:50;
}
```

<Tip>
  Minify the code or CSS by using any [CSS Minifier](https://www.minifier.org/).
  It helps you to reduce the characters in the code that will increase score.
