In this article, I will solve a [Cloaked Spirits](https://cssbattle.dev/play/10) CSS Challenge on [CSS Battle](https://cssbattle.dev/). Let's look at the problem first.

## Problem 

We need to create the following container by using CSS Properties only:
![Cloaked Spirits](https://cssbattle.dev/targets/10.png)

## Solution

So now look at the Solution and how we are going to achieve this. 

*Video's Code is a little bit different because in the following CSS code I've used `aspect-ratio` just to reduce character and to match the width and height which is not mentioned in the video. (Video code also works fine)*

### HTML


```html
<p b>
<p c>
```


### CSS

Now let's style the containers. 


```css
* {
  margin: 0;
  background: #62306d;
}
body {
  display: grid;
  place-items: center;
}
p {
  position: fixed;
  aspect-ratio: 1;
}
[b] {
  width: 100;
  background: #f7ec7d;
  box-shadow: -100px 100px #f7ec7d, 
              100px 100px #f7ec7d, 
              0 100px #f7ec7d;
}
[c] {
  width: 60;
  background: #aa445f;
  border-radius: 1in;
  bottom: 170;
  box-shadow: 0 0 0 20px #e38f66, 
              100px 100px #e38f66,
              100px 100px 0 20px #aa445f, 
              -100px 100px #e38f66,
              -100px 100px 0 20px #aa445f;
}
```



<Tip id="1">
  Note: In CSS Battle you can use `100` instead of `100px`. You don't need to define `px` in CSS. However, if you are using `rem` or `%`, you need to pass them separately. That's why in the above CSS code there are no units mostly. For more info [visit here](https://cssbattle.dev/tips).
</Tip>

<Tip id="2">
  Minify the code or CSS by using any [CSS Minifier](https://www.minifier.org/). It helps you to reduce the characters in the code which will increase the score.
</Tip>


**Minified Version:**
```text
<p b><p c><style>*{margin:0;background:#62306D}body{display:grid;place-items:center}p{position:fixed}[b]{height:100;width:100;background:#F7EC7D;bottom:0;left:50;box-shadow:100px -100px #F7EC7D,100px 0 #F7EC7D,200px 0 #F7EC7D}[c]{width:60;height:60;background:#AA445F;border-radius:1in;bottom:170;box-shadow:0 0 0 20px #E38F66,100px 100px #E38F66,100px 100px 0 20px #AA445F,-100px 100px #E38F66,-100px 100px 0 20px #AA445F}
```
