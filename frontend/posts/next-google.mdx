In this article, I am going to tell you about how I made Google fully functional Clone with `next.js` and `tailwind`. So Let's dive in.

In this we are not redirecting user to the google page, instead we are using google custom search API to perform all operation in the same domain _User can only fetch this API about 100 times so be careful with that you cannot search more that 100 times_

**Note** - If you are developing this by yourself then must use mock data so don't exhaust your API request limit

## Features

- Realtime and Accurate Google Search
- Full Screen mode
- Installable PWA
- Search Any Query
- Full Responsiveness
- Show your location based on you IP
- Dark Theme support based on user's device setting

## Technologies I've used

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Custom Search JSON API](https://rb.gy/0lfupd)

This is obvious that I cannot share all the code there for that you have to visit the repository, which link is given below, this is not a complex application it is very easy to set up you just need to have a basic understanding of React and TailwindCSS.
First, you need to create the next.js app and install all the dependencies which are required you can look at my `package.json`, and then you just code.
