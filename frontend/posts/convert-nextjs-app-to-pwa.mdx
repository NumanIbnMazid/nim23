To make Next.js app into PWA, we need the given things -

- `next-pwa` package
- Service Worker
- Manifest & Icons
- Maskable Icon
- Meta Tags

## 1\. `next-pwa` package

To convert your nextjs app into PWA you need to install this package via `npm` or `yarn`  
to install this run -

<CodeTitle lang="bash" title="bash" />
```bash 
npm i next-pwa # npm 
yarn add next-pwa # yarn
```

After installation go to your next `next.config.js` as update it as follows -

<CodeTitle lang="js" title="next.config.js" />
```js
const withPWA = require("next-pwa");
module.exports = withPWA({
  //...before
  pwa: {
    dest: "public",
    register: true,
    skipWaiting: true,
  },
  //...after
});
```

## 2\. Service Worker

We don't need to add external service worker the `next-pwa` will take care of that and it will auto generate the `sw.js` for us so we don't need to do anything in that

<CodeTitle title="directory" />
``` 
├── public
|  ├── sw.js
```

## 3\. Manifest and Icons

To gernerate Icon and Manifest Go to [PWA Manifest](https://www.simicart.com/manifest-generator.html/)

![manifest](https://i.imgur.com/ILwfs0f.png)

Fill all the details and attach the `icon` in 512x512 it will generate the icons and manifest for you and you can download the zip file.

Go to your public directory and create a folder `icons` and put all the icons in that folder like this

<CodeTitle title="directory" />
``` 
├── public
|  ├── icons
|  |  ├── icons.png
```

after that create a `manifest.json` in you `public/` which should be look like this -

<CodeTitle lang="json" title="manifest.json" />
```json
{
  "theme_color": "#000",
  "background_color": "#fff",
  "display": "standalone",
  "scope": "/",
  "start_url": "/",
  "name": "pwa",
  "short_name": "pwa",
  "description": "pwa",
  "icons": [
    {
      "src": "icons/icon-192x192.png",
      "sizes": "192x192",
      "type": "image/png"
    },
    {
      "src": "icons/icon-256x256.png",
      "sizes": "256x256",
      "type": "image/png"
    },
    {
      "src": "icons/icon-384x384.png",
      "sizes": "384x384",
      "type": "image/png"
    },
    {
      "src": "icons/icon-512x512.png",
      "sizes": "512x512",
      "type": "image/png"
    }
  ]
}
```

After that we need the `favicon` to get that go to [Favicon Generator](https://favicon.io/favicon-converter/) and upload your main icon and it will generate the rest of icon for you and download the zip after that from that we need only need two icon which is `favicon.ico` and `apple-touch-icon` put them into your `public/`

Here is the path -

<CodeTitle title="directory" />
``` 
├── public
|  ├── apple-touch-icon.png
|  ├── favicon.ico
|  ├── icons
|  |  ├── icon-192x192.png
|  |  ├── icon-256x256.png
|  |  ├── icon-384x384.png
|  |  ├── icon-512x512.png
|  |  └── maskable.png
|  ├── manifest.json
```

## 4. Maskable Icon

To make the maskabel icon we need to visit [Maskable Editor](https://maskable.app/editor) and upload your icon and edit it  
![masakable](https://i.imgur.com/WBk9a7y.png)

after editing export the icon but be care full with the ratio  
always choose the square ration and remember the ratio because we will need it in the `manifest`

![sizes](https://i.imgur.com/iAIctjQ.png)

After downloading the `icon` put it into the `public/icons/`

<CodeTitle title="directory" />
``` 
├── public
|  ├── icons
|  |  └── maskable.png
```

and add that to the `manifest.json`

<CodeTitle lang="json" title="manifest.json" />
```json

"icons": [
  // ...
  {
  "src": "maskable.png",
  "sizes": "48x48",
  "type": "image/x-icon",
  "purpose": "maskable"
  },
  //...
]
```

Here you need to specify the size of the maskable image if the image size is `512x512` then in the `json` it should be `"sizes": "512x512"`

## 5. Meta Tags

Now to get all this work we need some meta tags put them wher is the `Head` of your application, which are given below

<CodeTitle lang="html" title="index.html" />
```html
<Head>
  <meta charset="utf-8" />
  <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" />
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no" />
  <meta name="description" content="description of your project" />
  <meta name="theme-color" content="#000" />
  <title>Title of the project</title>
  <link rel="manifest" href="/manifest.json" />
  <link rel="shortcut icon" href="/favicon.ico" />
  <link rel="apple-touch-icon" href="/apple-icon.png"></link>
</Head>;
```

After all that Go to the Developer Console and Generate Resport for PWA in Lighthouse you will see the PWA and installable badge.
