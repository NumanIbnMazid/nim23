Yeah, I know we all have struggled with this situation. We want to center a `div` or `child` inside the parent element, but sometimes it won't work or it's hard to do. So now let me introduce to you 6 ways by which you can center a `div` mostly in every situation.

## Problem

We have 2 divs `parent` and `child` and we need to center `child` with respect to the `parent`.

<CodeTitle title="index.html" lang="html" />
```html
<div class="parent">
  <div class="child"></div>
</div>
```

Now we know what we want to achieve. So let's see what are the possible solutions for this problem.

## 1. Using Flexbox

The Flexible Box Layout Module, makes it easier to design flexible responsive layout structure.

Apply the following properties to `.parent` will center `.child` horizontally and vertically.

<CodeTitle title="styles.css" lang="css" />
```css
.parent {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}
```

## 2. Using Position

The `position` property specifies the type of positioning method used for an element (static, relative, fixed, absolute or sticky). We only need relative and absolute.

Apply following properties to `.parent` and `.child` will center `.child` horizontally and vertically.

<CodeTitle title="styles.css" lang="css" />
```css
.parent {
  position: relative;
}
.child {
  position: absolute;
  top: 50%;
  left: 50%;
  transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
}
```

## 3. Using CSS grid

The CSS Grid Layout Module offers a grid-based layout system, with rows and columns. we can center the `child` element with this as well.

Apply following properties to `.parent` will center `.child` horizontally and vertically.

<CodeTitle lang="css" title="styles.css" />
```css
.parent {
  display: grid;
  justify-content: center; /* Horizontal */
  align-content: center; /* Vertical */
}
```

Also there's one other way to use the Grid you can apply the following properties to `.parent`.

<CodeTitle lang="css" title="styles.css" />
```css
/* Another Approach */
.parent {
  display: grid;
  place-items: center;
}
```

## 4. Using `margin: auto` on a `flex` item

Flexbox introduced a pretty awesome behavior for `auto` margins. Now, it not only horizontally centers an element as it did in block layouts, but it also centers it in the vertical axis.

Apply following properties to `.parent` will center `.child` horizontally and vertically.

<CodeTitle lang="css" title="styles.css" />

```css
.parent {
  display: flex;
}

.child {
margin: auto;
}
```

## 5. Pseudo-elements on a `flex` container

Not the most practical approach in the world, but we can also use flexible, empty pseudo-elements to push an element to the center.

Apply following properties to `.parent` will center `.child` horizontally and vertically.

<CodeTitle lang="css" title="styles.css" />

```css
.parent {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
}
.parent::before,
.parent::after {
  content: "";
  flex: 1;
}
.child {
  /* ...other CSS */
  margin: 0 auto;
}
```

## 6. `margin: auto` on a `grid` item

Similarly to Flexbox, applying `margin:` `auto` on a `grid` item centers it on both axes.

<CodeTitle lang="css" title="styles.css" />
```css
.parent {
  display: grid;
}
.child {
  margin: auto;
}
```

## Wrapping up

These are not the only solution or the ways to center a child. There are many other ways to achieve the same thing, But I know only these so I shared them with you.
