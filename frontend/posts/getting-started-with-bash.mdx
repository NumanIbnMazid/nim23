In this article we are going to learn about what is bash and how we are going to install in windows? This is going to be a full series on Bash in which we are going to learn so much more.

According to Wikipedia,

> _Bash is a Unix shell and command language written by Brian Fox for the GNU Project as a free software replacement for the Bourne shell._

BASH is an acronym for Bourne Again Shell, It is a shell program written by Brian Fox as an upgraded version of Bourne Shell program '**sh**'. It was first released in 1989.

**Shell:** A UNIX Shell is a program or a command line interpreter that interprets the user commands which are either entered by the user directly or which can be read from a file and then pass them to the operating system for processing.

## Why Bash?

Bash Scripting is a powerful part of system administration and development used at an extreme level. People use Bash for **system administration, data crunching, web application deployment, automated backups, creating custom scripts for various pages,** etc. They can control their computer or OS without having to navigate menus, options, and windows within a GUI.

## What is Bash Script?

A Bash Shell Script is a simple and plain text file that contains various commands that we usually type in the command line. It might include loops, functions, conditional constructs, etc. Effectively. In other words **_Bash script is a computer program written in the Bash programming language._**

## Install Bash on Windows

### Method-1

To run bash on windows you need to install it first to do that First Run you windows **_Powershell_** or **_Windows Terminal_** as _Administrator_, then run the following command-

<CodeTitle lang="bash" title="bash" />
```bash
wsl --install
```

This could take a few minutes because its size is several MB. after the downloading is done you need to restart your system after that It’ll start downloading and installing _Ubuntu_, and then you’ll be prompted to pick a username and password. They don’t have to be related to your Windows 11 login details. After that, all is done. Now you have installed `bash` in your system.
