excerpt: This is the walkthrough of how you can make an active navigation bar by using Next.js router and it'll highlight the current page user visiting in the navbar.

Active Navbar means that when the user is on the `about` page, the `about` link should be highlighted in the navbar. and when the user is on a different page and its link is available in the navbar, that should be highlighted. 

If you don't get it then the following is the demo of what I am talking about and how it's gonna turn out-

## Preview

As you can see in the above demo when the user clicks any of the navbar sections the page route changes and the active page name is highlighted on the navbar. That's what are we going to build. 

## Creating Layout

If you don't have a Layout then you need to create a layout first. and Add that `Layout` component to the `_app.js`.

<CodeTitle lang="jsx" title="components/Layout.jsx" />
```jsx {1,5}
import Navbar from "./Navbar";
export default function Layout({ children }) {
  return (
    <>
      <Navbar />
      {children}
      {/* Footer */}
      {/* You can add more things here  */}
    </>
  );
}
```
In the above code, you can see that we are importing `Navbar` and then we are rendering the `Navbar` inside the `Layout`.

Now, after creating Layout we need to wrap our whole app with Layout. It should look something like this-

<CodeTitle lang="jsx" title="pages/_app.js" />
```jsx {2,5,7}
import "../styles/global.css";
import Layout from "./../components/Layout";
function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
  return (
    <Layout>
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </Layout>
  );
}
export default MyApp;
``` 

## Creating Navbar

Create a file name `Navbar.jsx` in the components folder. and first, import the `Link` and `useRouter` as we need those to check the current page route.

<CodeTitle lang="jsx" title="components/Navbar.jsx" />
```jsx {1.2}
import { useRouter } from "next/router";
import Link from "next/link";
```

Then we need to define all the routes which we have and want to show on the navbar.

<CodeTitle lang="jsx" title="components/Navbar.jsx" />
```jsx {4}
import { useRouter } from "next/router";
import Link from "next/link";

const navigationRoutes = ["home", "about", "pricing", "contact"];
```

Then we need to loop through `navigationRoutes` and render the elements.


<CodeTitle lang="jsx" title="components/Navbar.jsx" />
```jsx {6-22}
import { useRouter } from "next/router";
import Link from "next/link";

const navigationRoutes = ["home", "about", "pricing", "contact"];

export default function Navbar() {
  const router = useRouter();
  return (
    <nav className="nav_container">
      {navigationRoutes.map((singleRoute) => {
        return (
          <NavigationLink
            key={singleRoute}
            href={`/${singleRoute}`}
            text={singleRoute}
            router={router}
          />
        );
      })}
    </nav>
  );
}
```


In the above code, we are defining the `router` and then we are creating a `nav` container. After that, I am mapping `navigationRoutes` and for each route, we are returning `NavigationLink` which we will create in a minute.
**Props: **
- `href`: route link
- `text`: text that will be displayed on the navigation bar
- `router`: verify the current route

<CodeTitle lang="jsx" title="components/Navbar.jsx" />
```jsx {24-36}
import { useRouter } from "next/router";
import Link from "next/link";

const navigationRoutes = ["home", "about", "pricing", "contact"];

export default function Navbar() {
  const router = useRouter();
  return (
    <nav className="nav_container">
      {navigationRoutes.map((singleRoute) => {
        return (
          <NavigationLink
            key={singleRoute}
            href={`/${singleRoute}`}
            text={singleRoute}
            router={router}
          />
        );
      })}
    </nav>
  );
}

function NavigationLink({ href, text, router }) {
  const isActive = router.asPath === (href === "/home" ? "/" : href);
  return (
    <Link href={href === "/home" ? "/" : href} passHref>
      <a
        href={href === "/home" ? "/" : href}
        className={`${isActive && "nav_item_active"} nav_item`}
      >
        {text}
      </a>
    </Link>
  );
}
```


In this, we check if the current router path is the same as the `href` then return `true` for `isActive` and if the current route is active then apply the `nav_item_active` class.

This is all we need to create an active navigation bar and it works flawlessly. You can check the live demo on the following sandbox.
