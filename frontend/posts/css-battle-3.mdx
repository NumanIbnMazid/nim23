In this article, I will solve a [Push Button](https://cssbattle.dev/play/3) CSS Challenge on [CSS Battle](https://cssbattle.dev/). Let's look at the [problem](https://cssbattle.dev/play/3) first.

## Problem

We need to create the following container by using CSS Properties only:
![Simply Square](https://cssbattle.dev/targets/3.png)

## Solution

So now look at the Solution and how we are going to achieve this.

### HTML

<CodeTitle title="index.html" lang="html" />
```html
<div class="box"></div>
<div class="circle"></div>
```

It contains two `div` one for the box and the other for circle.

### CSS

Now let's style the containers.

<CodeTitle title="styles.css" lang="css"/>
```css
body {
  margin: 0;
  background: #6592CF
}
.box {
  background: #243D83;
  width: 300;
  height: 150;
  transform: translate(50px, 50%)
}
.circle {
  position: absolute;
  transform: translate(75px, -50%);
  background: #243D83;
  width: 150;
  height: 150;
  border: 50px solid #6592CF;
  border-radius: 999px
}
.circle::before {
  position: absolute;
  content: "";
  border-radius: 10rem;
  inset: 50px;
  width: 50;
  height: 50;
  background: #EEB850
}
```

> In CSS Battle you can use `100` instead of `100px`. You don't need to define `px` in CSS. However, if you are using `rem` or `%` then you need to pass them separately. That's why in the above CSS code there are no units mostly. For more info [visit here](https://cssbattle.dev/tips)

## Alternate Solution

There could be many Alternative Solution I've used this one because of the less characters and simplicity.

### HTML

<CodeTitle title="index.html" lang="html" />

```html
<p b></p>
<p c></p>
```

Here I am using `<p>` tag and inside them `b` stands for box and `c` stands for circle.

### CSS

<CodeTitle title="styles.css" lang="css"/>
```css
body {
  margin: 0;
  background: #6592CF
}
p[b] {
  background: #243D83;
  width: 300;
  height: 150;
  transform: translate(50px, 50%)
}
p[c] {
  position: absolute;
  transform: translate(75px, -63%);
  background: #243D83;
  width: 150;
  height: 150;
  border: 50px solid #6592CF;
  border-radius: 999px
}
p[c]::before {
  position: absolute;
  content: "";
  border-radius: 10rem;
  inset: 50px;
  width: 50;
  height: 50;
  background: #EEB850
}
```

<Tip>
  Minify the code or CSS by using any [CSS Minifier](https://www.minifier.org/).
  It helps you to reduce the characters in the code that will increase score.
