On my website, there is a [stats](/stats) page, which showcases many things such as my Dev. To blog stats and the GitHub repository count and the Spotify stats, we will talk about how you can implement that in your dream project.


## Preview

Let's first Look what am talking about. The following images are just to showcase what I made with Spotify API.

## Create a Spotify App

Firstly, we need to create an application on the spotify-

- Go to [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/)
- Login with Spotify Account
  ![Login](https://i.imgur.com/ytuIfqq.png)
- Click on **Create an App**
- Fill the Name and the Description then Click **Create**
  ![create](https://i.imgur.com/KJi9pWu.png)
- Save your Client ID and Secret in your `.env.local`
- Click on **Edit Setting** on top-right and add the `http://localhost:3000/callback` as the _callback url_ and click on **Save**.

Everything is done. Now let's get into the authentication stuff.

## Authentication with `refresh_token`

There are many types of authentication we are going with `refresh_token` because we only want to authenticate once. You can learn about Authorization [here](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization/)

<Figcaption

  caption="Authorization Code Flow"
/>


### Authorization Code

As you can see in the above image we have everything except [scopes](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization/scopes/). Which defines, what we need fetch from the Spotify API.

To do that we need a `url` that send the following parameter to the Spotify-

- `response_type` : it should be `code` (as shown in the image)
- `redirect_uri` : callback url same as you enter in the Spotify Dashboard
- `client_id` : your project's `client_id`
- `scope` : you can read about that [here](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization/scopes/)

We want to fetch the user's top stats and the currently playing song. for that scope is `user-top-read` and `user-read-currently-playing`. You can add as many scopes as you want separated by plus ("+"). So, now our URL looks like this (enter your project `client_id`)-

<CodeTitle title="URL" />
```bash
https://accounts.spotify.com/authorize?client_id=bda10cd719564898818245d97727de7e&response_type=code&redirect_uri=http://localhost:3000/callback&scope=user-read-currently-playing+user-top-read 
```

Now enter the URL in the browser and then click **Enter**. After authorizing, you'll be redirected back to your `redirect_uri`. In the URL, there's a `code` query parameter. Store this value somewhere because we are going to need it in the next step.

<CodeTitle title="Code" />
```bash
http://localhost:3000/callback?code=CDxRCu......NLdsM
```

### Get `refresh_token`

After doing all this work now we need to get the `refresh_token` to authorization. You'll need to generate a Base 64 encoded string containing the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from earlier. You can use this [tool](https://www.base64encode.org/) to encode it online. The format should be exactly the same as this `client_id:client_secret`.

Your url should look like this - 

<CodeTitle lang="bash" title="Demo URL" />
```bash
# URL to get "refresh_token"

curl -H "Authorization: Basic <base64 encoded client_id:client_secret>" -d grant_type=authorization_code -d code=<code> -d redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost:3000/callback https://accounts.spotify.com/api/token
```

So after encoding the  **Client ID** and **Client Secret** it should be looks like this-

<CodeTitle title="client_id:client_secret"/>
```bash
YmRhMTBjZDcxOTU2NDg5ODgxODJmMmQ5NzcyN2RlN2U6NjZmZTU5OTJjYjZlNDFjZmEwNDdfkdjfkHKkjdfdwODk0YjI=
```

Now the final url should looks like this-

<CodeTitle lang="bash" title="Auth URL"/>
```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Basic YmRhMTBjZDcxOTU2NDg5ODgxODJmMmQ5NzcyN2RlN2U6NjZmZTU5OTJjYjZlNDFjZmEwNDdfkdjfkHKkjdfdwODk0YjI=" -d grant_type=authorization_code -d code=AQD_kIzZ0OVXkeeIU4jnLWADFJDKdcWLYo9ySdfdfdkHKJFtGExxgw_aCxJrZflWVeARvjaGDfdfddf6KYpFlo2t2JZ0SQceyvdKs4AcGgCLSqm7vMyiRWCy_t06WmLet8v6aEBx8U4eKHxKiEx_sBgvCSlYo5wptKUd0Gwa6oyqOHFZnE7KSbxTVwMkQ668Ezjz2aeFEPp1TU9ij6dM4AjO4YFCH2hoMWgO3k5XrbdKnK7U2Y30wb8gHjEA6LnE8yu8cyvaY9WQ -d redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost:3000/callback https://accounts.spotify.com/api/token
```

After running this on your terminal it will return a JSON object containing `refresh_token`. This token is valid indefinitely unless you revoke access, so we'll want to save this in an environment variable. The JSON will looks like this- 

```json
{
  "access_token":"DKjdfkdjkdfjdRU67VlhTLc3HUHHRvcG6W3F56ISDFodvSiSmFZIIUwOzzZCyCcgOia-TXX-y_wq8n7jEHTI0JEYO6djABMQmlutMqsUPgEiVJ2isj98BrBYFV4dfdsjkfksudJKDUIkdfdfdk1vxR07V_r7Y-aLjMyqwBaSqxneFokM",
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "expires_in": 3600,
  "refresh_token":"dfkdjkkdjfdfrrdkfjd9984maWbrIrXqNNK63SOzJdWQGaTYQGD6Ji1dWsAywEgm-eUspfuOlug8f71XL2oBWtD_pzd6EzCWwqCVnDSWspbJelOwVDY62TuAI",
  "scope": "user-read-currently-playing user-top-read user-read-private"
}

```

That's a lot to digest, but now our work is done, we have all the necessary things we needed for authorization.

## Setting up Environment Variables

Now all the things we get in the above process we need to add those to the `.env.local`

<CodeTitle title=".env.local" />
```bash
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=
SPOTIFY_REFRESH_TOKEN=
```


## Using Spotify API

Now we can use the `refresh_token` to get the final `access_token`. The following Code fetches the `access_token` by using the `refresh_token`  


<CodeTitle lang="js" title="lib/spotify.js" />
```js
const getAccessToken = async () => {
  const refresh_token = process.env.SPOTIFY_REFRESH_TOKEN;

  const response = await fetch("https://accounts.spotify.com/api/token", {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
      Authorization: `Basic ${Buffer.from(
        `${process.env.SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID}:${process.env.SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET}`
      ).toString("base64")}`,
      "Content-Type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded",
    },
    body: new URLSearchParams({
      grant_type: "refresh_token",
      refresh_token,
    }),
  });

  return response.json();
};
```

### Fetch the Top Tracks

Now you can use this `access_token` fetch your data. In our case it is the top tracks. 

<CodeTitle lang="js" title="lib/spotify.js" />
```js
export const topTracks = async () => {
  const { access_token } = await getAccessToken();

  return fetch("https://api.spotify.com/v1/me/top/tracks", {
    headers: {
      Authorization: `Bearer ${access_token}`,
    },
  });
};
```

#### Creating API route top tracks

In the beginning, I mentioned that we are going to use the Next.js API routes. If you are not familiar with that then [give this a read](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction)


<CodeTitle lang="js" title="pages/api/stats/tracks.js" />
```js
import { topTracks } from "../../../lib/spotify";

export default async function handler(req, res) {
  const response = await topTracks();
  const { items } = await response.json();

  const tracks = items.slice(0, 5).map((track) => ({
    title: track.name,
    artist: track.artists.map((_artist) => _artist.name).join(", "),
    url: track.external_urls.spotify,
    coverImage: track.album.images[1],
  }));

  res.setHeader(
    "Cache-Control",
    "public, s-maxage=86400, stale-while-revalidate=43200"
  );

  return res.status(200).json(tracks);
}
```

This will return the first five top tracks, I've removed unnecessary information. You can modify this as you like. Now visit the `localhost:3000/api/stats/tracks`. If everything worked correctly,  you should see some data like this -

<CodeTitle lang="js" title="localhost:3000/api/stats/tracks" />
```json
[
  // ...........
 {
    "title": "Blowing Up",
    "artist": "KR$NA",
    "url": "https://open.spotify.com/track/3Oh2FwWbnKIAyUE2gToFYu",
    "coverImage": {
      "height": 300,
      "url": "https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d00001e02f8c35169d5bab01327f87e5a",
      "width": 300
    }
  },
  {
    "title": "Jaan Bolti Hai",
    "artist": "Karma",
    "url": "https://open.spotify.com/track/4KGZlLtfKV4raRbsoB2Rw9",
    "coverImage": {
      "height": 300,
      "url": "https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d00001e028e3626063a42b11b847663b3",
      "width": 300
    }
  },
  //.........
]
```
To see my stats you can visit `https://jatin.vercel.app/api/stats/tracks`.



### Fetch the Top Artist

Now you can use this `access_token` fetch your data. In our case it is the top artists.

<CodeTitle lang="js" title="lib/spotify.js" />
```js
export const topArtists = async () => {
  const { access_token } = await getAccessToken();

  return fetch("https://api.spotify.com/v1/me/top/artists", {
    headers: {
      Authorization: `Bearer ${access_token}`,
    },
  });
};
```

#### Creating API route top artists

<CodeTitle lang="js" title="pages/api/stats/artists.js" />
```js
import { topArtists } from "../../../lib/spotify";

export default async function handler(req, res) {
  const response = await topArtists();
  const { items } = await response.json();

  const artists = items.slice(0, 5).map((artist) => ({
    name: artist.name,
    url: artist.external_urls.spotify,
    coverImage: artist.images[1],
    followers: artist.followers.total,
  }));

  res.setHeader(
    "Cache-Control",
    "public, s-maxage=86400, stale-while-revalidate=43200"
  );

  return res.status(200).json(artists);
}
```

It returns your's top Spotify artists.

### Fetch the Currently Playing Song

Now, as you can see on my [website's](http://jatin.vercel.app/) footer there is an option to see if I am currently playing the song or not, if yes then which one. To do that, we fetch the following URL.

<CodeTitle lang="js" title="lib/spotify.js" />
```js
export const currentlyPlayingSong = async () => {
  const { access_token } = await getAccessToken();

  return fetch("https://api.spotify.com/v1/me/player/currently-playing", {
    headers: {
      Authorization: `Bearer ${access_token}`,
    },
  });
};
```

#### Creating API route for Currently Playing Song

<CodeTitle lang="js" title="pages/api/now-playing .js" />
```js
import { currentlyPlayingSong } from "../../lib/spotify";

export default async function handler(req, res) {
  const response = await currentlyPlayingSong();

  if (response.status === 204 || response.status > 400) {
    return res.status(200).json({ isPlaying: false });
  }

  const song = await response.json();

  if (song.item === null) {
    return res.status(200).json({ isPlaying: false });
  }

  const isPlaying = song.is_playing;
  const title = song.item.name;
  const artist = song.item.artists.map((_artist) => _artist.name).join(", ");
  const album = song.item.album.name;
  const albumImageUrl = song.item.album.images[0].url;
  const songUrl = song.item.external_urls.spotify;

  res.setHeader(
    "Cache-Control",
    "public, s-maxage=60, stale-while-revalidate=30"
  );

  return res.status(200).json({
    album,
    albumImageUrl,
    artist,
    isPlaying,
    songUrl,
    title,
  });
}
```

This returns all the song details if the user is playing the song. Otherwise, `isPlaying` will return `false`. You can handle both the conditions now. If the user is playing the song, then simply show the song Otherwise Display Not Playing.


<Tip>
You should use `swr` to fetch the data Otherwise it will show you the old data which you might not like.
