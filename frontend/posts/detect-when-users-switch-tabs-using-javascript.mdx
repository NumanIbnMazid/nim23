In this article, I'll show you how to find out when users change tabs in browsers using JavaScript. It's going to be fun, it's helpful to see how often the user loses his attention. You can even use it to add the data to the database (it is out of the scope of this article).

There are two ways I know how to solve this problem. So, I'll be showing you both of them.

## Method - 1

In this method, we will you two event listeners [focus](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/focus_event) (when the user focuses on your website or window) and [blur](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/blur_event) (when the user loses focus)

We don't need HTML actually, because when users are on another tab so they won't see your website page. Only JavaScript will do:

```js
// when the user loses focus
window.addEventListener("blur", () => {
  document.title = "Breakup";
});

// when the user's focus is back to your tab (website) again
window.addEventListener("focus", () => {
  document.title = "Patch Up";
});
```

## Method - 2

In this method, we only need one event listener ([visibilitychange](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/visibilitychange_event)). It has a property called `visibilityState` which we can use to detect the window switching state.

```js
document.addEventListener("visibilitychange", () => {
  // it could be either hidden or visible
  document.title = document.visibilityState;
});
```

You can use these to add many functionality to your website such as stop music or video when the user loses focus:

```js
document.addEventListener("visibilitychange", () => {
  if (document.visibilityState === "visible") {
    music.play();
  } else {
    music.pause();
  }
});
```
