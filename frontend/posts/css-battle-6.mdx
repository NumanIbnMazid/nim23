In this article, I will solve a [Missing Slice](https://cssbattle.dev/play/6) CSS Challenge on [CSS Battle](https://cssbattle.dev/). Let's look at the [problem](https://cssbattle.dev/play/6) first.

## Problem 

We need to create the following container by using CSS Properties only:
![Missing Slice](https://cssbattle.dev/targets/6.png)

## Solution

So now look at the Solution and how we are going to achieve this. 

### HTML


<CodeTitle title="index.html" lang="html"/>
```html
<div class="one"></div>
<div class="two"></div>
<div class="three"></div>
```


I took three divs to create the shape. Each one of them represents a slice.

### CSS

Now let's style the body container first. 

<CodeTitle title="styles.css" lang="css"/>
```css
body {
  margin: 0;
  background: #e3516e;
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;
}
```
I have used a `grid` to layout the children. `grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr` property defines that there should be two columns with `1fr`. Here `fr` represents a fraction of the available space in the grid container. 

Now Let's style the individual slices

<CodeTitle title="styles.css" lang="css"/>
```css {7-25}
body {
  margin: 0;
  background: #e3516e;
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;
}
.one, .two, .three {
  width: 100;
  height: 100;
}
.one {
  background: #51b5a9;
  border-radius: 100% 0 0 0; 
  place-self: end;
}
.two {
  background: #fade8b;
  border-radius: 0 100% 0 0;
  place-self: end start;
}
.three {
  background: #f7f3d7;
  border-radius: 0 0 0 100%;      /* top-left , top-right, bottom-right, bottom-left */
  place-self: start end;
}
```

In the above code, you can see that I have used [place-self](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/place-self) in all of the slices. The `place-self` CSS shorthand property allows you to align an individual item in both the block and inline directions at once (i.e. the `align-self` and `justify-self` properties).

<Tip>
  Note: In CSS Battle you can use `100` instead of `100px`. You don't need to define `px` in CSS. However, if you are using `rem` or `%`, you need to pass them separately. That's why in the above CSS code there are no units mostly. For more info [visit here](https://cssbattle.dev/tips)

## Alternate Solution
There could be many Alternative Solutions I've used this one because of the fewer characters and simplicity.


### HTML

<CodeTitle title="index.html" lang="html"/>
```html
<p f>
<p s>
<p t>
```

Here `f` stands for the First slice, `s` stands for the Second slice, and `t` stands for the third slice.  

### CSS

<CodeTitle title="styles.css" lang="css"/>
```css
* { margin:0 }  
body {
  background: #e3516e;
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;
}
[f], [s], [t] {
  width: 100;
  height: 100;
}
[f] {
  background: #51b5a9;
  border-radius: 100% 0 0 0;
  place-self: end;
}
[s] {
  background: #fade8b;
  border-radius: 0 100% 0 0;
  place-self: end start;
}
[t] {
  background: #f7f3d7;
  border-radius: 0 0 0 100%;
  place-self: start end;
}
```

<Tip id="2">
  Minify the code or CSS by using any [CSS Minifier](https://www.minifier.org/). It helps you to reduce the characters in the code which will increase the score.
