Hello! I am **Jatin Sharma**, a **front-end developer/React developer** from India. As a developer, I am deeply interested in both design and coding, and I enjoy using **React.js** or **Next.js** to build web application interfaces and functionality. I am currently focused on completing my Bachelor's degree in **Computer Science**.

My interest in computers started at a very young age, and I was very eager to learn as much as I could about them. I remember my **first website** that I made years ago, which had a **terrible interface** and design. The purpose of it was to download movies and stuff like that. It is unfortunate that I don't have the code.

I have always had a strong interest in computers and technology. From a young age, I was eager to learn as much as possible. One of my earliest experiences with computers was creating my own website, which unfortunately had a terrible interface and design. Despite this, I was excited to be able to create something on my own and share it with others. The website's purpose was to allow users to download movies and other content. Unfortunately, I no longer have the code for this site, but it remains a memorable experience for me.

After this, I became more and more interested in **web development** and began to find resources to learn more about it. I watched many video tutorials, read through documentation and articles. The **first programming language** I learned was **C**, and from there, I also learned **Python** and **C++**. In addition to working with programming languages, I have also experimented with **databases** and have found that **Firebase** is my favorite so far. I have also used **MySQL** and **Supabase** few time. Even this website's static data comes from **Supabase**.

In addition to my work, I also enjoy writing about web development topics on my [blog](https://j471n/blogs) and on [DEV](https://dev.to) as well. While I don't currently have much time or interest in playing video games. But, I do enjoy watching sci-fi movies and web series in my free time.

If you were to ask me what stack I would prefer, I would say:

- Framework - **Next.js**
- Database : **Firebase**
- CSS - **TailwindCSS**

You can do anything you can think of with these three things. Next.js is an open-source web development framework built on top of Node.js enabling React-based web applications functionalities such as server-side rendering and generating static websites.

I love my work and take great enjoyment (sometimes frustration) in every project that I take on. Feel free to check out my portfolio. If you have any questions or are interested in working with me, don't hesitate to reach out to me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/j471n_) or you can send me a mail at [me@j471n.in](mailto:me@j471n.in). I have also written an [article](https://j471n.in/blogs/portfolio-tutorial) explaining the process I followed to create my portfolio. You can also take a look at the full code at [GitHub](https://github.com/j471n/j471n.in).
